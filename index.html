			<p>"You know, a lot of people today are saying that this generation of kids are in fact are[sic] the stupidest.
				Now that's debatable. Now I believe there have always been stupid people.
				But the internet provides greater opportunity for stupidity to be expressed and paraded. In this day and age with the internet, ignorance is a choice!
